Git Game Finish Line
==========

If you did not update the main git-game repository, then we are disappointed in you!!
=======

However, if you did, then great Job!!
You completed our Git Game!


Well you:

- viewed previous commits using "git log"
- traversed to previous commits
- checked out to different branches
- ran "git blame" to see who made changes to a file
- ran the diff command to see differences between branches
- saw what .gitignore included and how it works
- resolved merged conflicts
- saw issues with naming tags and branches the same name
- updated a local repository from a remote repository
 
 Version control systems like git are extremely important tools to learn and use, 
 Especially when collaborating on projects with other developers. 
 It is our hope that you continue to practice your git skills so that you can one day become the ultimate git master!

 Thanks for playing!
